# med-agenda-admin
Admin frontend application for MedAgenda project
I used ChartJS and MomentJS among others for the admin dashboard analytics for hospital admin to see how many doctors and patients 
are checked-in at a certain period of time, which includes triage priorities for patients so admin know how to adjust scheduling 
and plan ahead based on previous year's patient volume.
